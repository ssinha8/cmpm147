            <p>
              This project is a dungeon generator. It creates random dungeons
              with hallways and sometimes treasure chests. There are water pits
              that bubble and change based on millis().

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            Autotiling: The waterpits, and floor of the dungeon were implemented
            using autotiling meaning the tiles were chosen based on codes set by
            determining what the orthogonal tiles were. So if a floor tile is
            surrounded by non-floor tiles, it would have a code of 0. If it were
            surrounded by floor tiles, it would have a code of 15. These codes
            determine what tile is used for that text-code.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            While coding Experiment 3, I found myself becoming immersed in
            smaller and smaller details. For example, my hallways are carefully
            generated to avoid any possible grid codes that would not fit with
            the tiles provided to retain its aesthetic. I also altered the
            provided sub functions in order to create target lists to have
            several different autotiling interactions between text-codes that I
            may not want to exclude from one another. I'm hoping to continue
            working on the details of this project to make it even more
            imaginative and active.
