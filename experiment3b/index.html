            <p>
              This project is an overworld generator. It creates random lakes
              and groves of trees. Houses are randomly spawned and the water
              shimmers using millis() to iterate through shimmering tiles.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            Autotiling: The lake and beach of the overworld were implemented
            using autotiling meaning the tiles were chosen based on codes set by
            determining what the orthogonal tiles were. So if a floor tile is
            surrounded by non-floor tiles, it would have a code of 0. If it were
            surrounded by floor tiles, it would have a code of 15. These codes
            determine what tile is used for that text-code.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            While coding Experiment 3, I found myself becoming immersed in
            smaller and smaller details. For example, my lakes are carefully
            generated to mimic random natural formations and not basic shapes.
            In order to do this, I set a bounding rectangular box and have a
            random amount of 'explosions' that are ellipses happen within that
            box. Any tiles that would fall within that ellipse become lake
            tiles. I'm hoping to continue working on the details of this project
            to make it even more imaginative and active such as adding a river
            generation function.
