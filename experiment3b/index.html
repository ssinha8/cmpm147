          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project offers a generative, living impression of this
            inspiring image:
            <img src="./img/source.jpg" />
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Color: All colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the
              eyedropper tool from Aseprite available on Steam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Primitives: The sun is rendered with `circle` primitives. The
              petals are rendered with `ellipse` primitives. The branches are
              rendered with `quad` primitives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Polygons: The mountain is a single polygon generated with calls to
              `bezierVertex`. The tree trunk is also a single polygon generated
              with calls to `bezierVertex`.
            </li>
            <li>
              Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently
              shaped mountains, sun positions, and differently positioned
              branches and petal clusters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Life: The perspective of the image acts as if you were standing
              there and could slightly move right or left. The tree and its
              branches move slightly in the direction of your mouse cursor. The
              branches move as if they are affected by wind and the petals are
              also flowing as if wind was influencing them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            While grinding through Experiment 2, I found myself becoming
            immersed in smaller and smaller details. For example, my branches
            are recursively generated which is definitely one of my best choices
            for my design. I think it adds a lot of spice when hitting the
            reimagine button. I'm hoping to continue working on the details of
            this project to make it even more imaginative and active. I really
            like the living portion of the impression and hope to add more.
